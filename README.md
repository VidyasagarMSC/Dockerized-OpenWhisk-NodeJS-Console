# Node.js OpenWhisk Webui - Query Console

The Webui demonstrates a simple, reusable Node.js web application based on the Express framework that interacts with OpenWhisk APIs and provides an interface to list and Invoke actions,Packages and API gateway routes. The app extensively uses JavaScript client library(npm package) for the OpenWhisk platform.

OpenWhisk is a serverless platform that lets developers quickly and easily build feature-rich apps that automatically trigger responses to events.
