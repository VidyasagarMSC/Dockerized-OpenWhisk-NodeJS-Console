# Node.js OpenWhisk Query Console DOCKER-ized to quickly run and manage

The Webui demonstrates a simple, reusable Node.js web application based on the Express framework that interacts with OpenWhisk APIs and provides an interface to list and Invoke actions,Packages and API gateway routes. The app extensively uses JavaScript client library(npm package) for the OpenWhisk platform.

OpenWhisk is a serverless platform that lets developers quickly and easily build feature-rich apps that automatically trigger responses to events.

## Prerequisites
1. Bluemix account.
2. OpenWhisk CLI.
3. Cloudfoundry or Bluemix CLI.
4. Docker CLI

## Getting Started
- Donâ€™t have Bluemix account? <a title="(Opens in a new tab or window)" href="https://console.ng.bluemix.net/registration/" target="_blank">Sign up</a> to create a free trial account.
- Have a Bluemix account? Use <a title="(Opens in a new tab or window)" href="https://console.ng.bluemix.net/openwhisk/editor" target="_blank">this link</a>.

### Develop in your Browser

Try out OpenWhisk in your [Browser](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/openwhisk/editor) to create actions, automate actions using triggers, and explore public packages. Visit the [learn more](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/openwhisk/learn) page for a quick tour of the OpenWhisk User Interface.

### Setting up the OpenWhisk CLI

You can use the OpenWhisk command line interface (CLI) to set up your namespace and authorization key. Go to [Configure CLI](https://new-console.ng.bluemix.net/openwhisk/cli) and follow the instructions to install it.


## Run the app locally

- Clone the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/VidyasagarMSC/Dockerized-OpenWhisk-NodeJS-Console.git
```
- Create a newfile and save it as .env in the root of the folder.Add the below
  values to .env file and save

```
 OpenWhisk_HOST = "openwhisk.ng.bluemix.net"
 OpenWhisk_AuthKey=" "
```
<br>For OpenWhisk auth key, run the below command
```
wsk property get --auth
```
- Navigate to the root of the folder and run the below command to build by tagging your docker image
```
docker build -t <your username>/node-openwhisk-docker
```
- To see your image run the below command
```
docker images
```
### Run the docker image
- Running your image with -d runs the container in detached mode, leaving the container running in the background. The -p flag redirects a public port to a private port inside the container. Run the image you previously built:

```
$ docker run -p 49160:6001 -d <your username>/node-openwhisk-docker
```

- Access the running app in a browser at http://localhost:49160
## Running on IBM Containers

Refer this [post](http://vidyasagarmsc.com/creating-a-docker-container-on-bluemix/)

- To assign an IP address

```
bx ic ip-request
```

## Test your app Web UI

- http://localhost:49160/invoke/MyWatsonSequence?message=Interconnect (Try with different message values and use %20 if there is a space in your message like hello%20world)
-   http://localhost:49160/list/actions
- 	http://localhost:49160/list/routes
- 	http://localhost:49160/list/packages

Replace localhost:6007 with your Bluemix Hostname or IP address to test this on your public url.
